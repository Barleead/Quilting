Hello and welcome!

This project covers something near and dear to my heart…quilting. When I was younger my mother would make the most beautiful quilts. While they were in the quilting frame (to allow for hand stitching of the quilt), I would sit underneath and as the light filtered through I would imagine that it was stained glass. I picked up my mother’s love of quilting (and other crafting projects) and at a young age, about 6 or so, I made my first quilt, just the right size for a doll. I have learned other crafts over the years: knitting, crocheting, latch hook, cross stitch. I always return to sewing/quilting eventually.

I have broken the project into 5 sections:

Home: a welcome and thank you for visiting
Patterns: just a few of my favorites with links to Fat Quarter Quilts where you can browse their site and maybe find your own favorites.
Information: This is a page for tips/tricks for quilting and other crafts.  
Resources: This page has the map and the inch/centimeter converter.
Contact: A way for visitors to start a conversation with me about any questions/topics.

Features:

API: Foxes
My API was the product of trial and error. Various tutorials were used as well as feedback from fellow students and mentors. It is on the Information page to provide a break for a crafter when things don’t go well.

Map: Google Maps
Google provided the code for this aspect of the project. I felt it was a good addition as I travel looking for crafting stores and a good map resource is essential. It defaults to Joann’s as that store is a favorite of mine

Converter:
Many times I have gotten a pattern from someone and it would be in cm and I would have to convert it to inches before I could use it. Also, outside the US, the metric system is used so the dimensions of cloth pieces may be deceptive.

Email form:
A way for fellow crafters to share ideas with the site or ask questions of me.

To run this project you will need VS Code and Git.

How to run:
Go to github.com/Barleead/Quilting and clone or fork the repository.

Open Git – If you need to install Git, the steps can be found here: Git Guides - install git · GitHub

Enter the following commands to create a virtual environment:

    Windows:

python -m venv venv
source venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.

Linux/Mac0S:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

After the virtual environment is created, enter “git clone” followed by the URL you copied when cloning the repository.

Open VS code and navigate to File > Open Folder. Then navigate to the location where the repository was copied. Highlight the “Quilting” folder and click open.

If you already have the Live Server extension then you can right click on any .html file and choose “Open with Live Server”. If you do not have the extension, you can add it by selecting the extensions icon (on the left) and searching for Live Server.

Acknowledgements:

I would like to thank my mentors, Blake Herbert and Michael Puckett for the encouragement/motivation and syntax/code suggestions.

Chris Metcalfe, Sebastian Frohm, and Ken Quiggens answered questions, shared ideas and made recommendations on when and where I should alter my code.

I used a few websites to also get help with definitions, syntax and steps: Google, Pluralsight, Scrimba, Free Code Camp and MDN. These are the ones I used the most.

A huge “Thank you” to the Fat Quarter Shop, for permission to use some of the patterns and pictures from their site.
