          Hello and welcome to "I üíûÔ∏è Quilting".<br />

          <br />
          My name is Barbara Adkins and I am an avid crafter. I do various
          crafts: cross stitch, crochet and latchhook, among others. Quilting is
          a favorite hobby of mine. I made my first quilt top when I was 6...
          for one of my dolls. I love being creative and using my skills for
          friends and family. This website will provide some tools and
          information for crafters. The directory below will help you navigate
          the site. If you have any questions/concerns please use the email form
          on the contact page to reach out.
