Hello Barbi,
Thank you for choosing Fat Quarter Shop!

I got your message. We actually get asked this question frequently!

The standard for free patterns is as follows:
=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8BWe do not allow our free patterns to be mass produced for=
 groups, guilds, classes, etc.=C2=A0 The guilds can email their members the=
 links to a free pattern on the Fat Quarter Shop website as a resource, whe=
re members can choose to view, download and print the pattern individually =
from Fat Quarter Shop. However, it cannot be linked to a class or event whe=
re a fee is paid as that would, by our definition, fall under commercial us=
e. =C2=A0 Additionally, we do allow guilds or other organizations to use FQ=
S free patterns to make quilts for raffles and fundraisers.=C2=A0

On a side note, if you are printing the pattern for a friend (not mass prin=
ting it or selling it) then you would be ok to print it for them.=C2=A0 I w=
ould suggest having guild members who can't print their  pattern reach out =
for help separately to friends. =20

In your case since you are referencing us and using the pattern for your pr=
oject with no intent to sell or print the pattern for others to use you sho=
uld be just fine crediting us as you plan.

I hope this has been helpful, but please let us know if you have any other =
questions and we'll do our best!=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B=E2=80=
=8B
Have a great day and good luck with your project!=20
