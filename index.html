          Hello and welcome to "I < 3 Quilting". I am an avid crafter. I do
          various crafts: cross stitch, crochet and latchhook, among other.
          Quilting is a favorite hobby of mine. I made my first quilt top when I
          was 6... for one of my dolls. I love being creative and using my
          skills for friends and family. This website will provide some tools
          and information for crafters.
